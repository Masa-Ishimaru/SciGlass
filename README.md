# SciGlass

The largest glass property database contains data for more than 420 thousand glass compositions including more than 18 thousand halide and about 38 thousand chalcogenide glasses. It provides also property predictions and calculations, help you solve R&D problems.


# The purpose of this Fork

This Fork contains zipped Gcomp, SciGK, Reference, and ARHIV files in the SciGlass database provided by EPAM. To use them with SciGlass-Pandas in my another repository, uncompress the zipped files and put them in the data_SciGlass folder in the same repository.
